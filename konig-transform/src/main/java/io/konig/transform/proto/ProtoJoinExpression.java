/**
 * An entity that expresses a constraint for joining two shapes.  It consists of left and right FromItem instances,
 * and a boolean expression for the join condition.
 * 
 * <h3>Example</h3>
 * Suppose you want to lookup the birth place of the founder of the 
 * company that manufactures a given product.  You might formulate a SQL query
 * like this...
 * <pre>
 *   SELECT Place.name
 *   FROM
 *   	Product
 *   JOIN
 *   	Organization ON Organization.id = Product.manufacturer
 *   JOIN
 *   	Person ON Person.id = Organization.founder
 *   JOIN
 *   	Place ON Place.id = Person.birthPlace
 *   WHERE
 *   	Product.id={productIdValue}
 * </pre>
 * Schematically, the FromItem within this query would like something like this...
 * <pre>
 *   ProtoJoinExpression(
 *   	Product, 
 *   	ProtoJoinExpression(
 *   		Organization,
 *   		ProtoJoinExpression(
 *   			Person,
 *   			Place,
 *   			ProtoJoinExpression(EQUALS, birthPlace, id)
 *   		)
 *   		ProtoBooleanExpression(EQUALS, founder, id)
 *   	),
 *   	ProtoBooleanExpression(EQUALS, manufacturer, id)
 *   )
 * </pre>
 *
